<p align="justify">
    <b>ReactICS</b> is a toolkit that allows for verification of Reaction Systems.
    The toolkit consists of two separate modules implementing:
    <ul>
    <li>Methods using binary decision diagrams (BDD)
        for storing and manipulating the state space of the verified system.</li>
    <li>Methods translating the verification problems into satisfiability modulo theories (SMT).</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p align="justify">
    <b>ReactICS GUI</b> offers a graphical user interface allowing for editing the reaction system details
    and model checking using BDD module.

<p align="justify">
    <b>Reaction Systems</b> are a formalism inspired by the functioning of living cells.
    They allow for specifying and analysing computational processes in which reactions operate on sets of molecules.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    The behaviour of a reaction system is determined by the interactions of its reactions, which are based on
    the mechanisms of facilitation and inhibition.
    The formal treatment of reaction systems is qualitative and there is no direct representation of the number
    of molecules involved in reactions.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    A <b>Distributed Reaction System</b> is a computational model in which multiple autonomous processes (aka. agents)
    interact locally through rule-based reactions.
    Each agent operates independently (without any central controllerâ€”coordination),
    processing inputs and producing outputs based on predefined reactions,
    and their collective behavior leads to complex system dynamics.

<ul>
    <li><b>New process</b> - Creates a new empty process.</li>

<a name="ctx-edit"><h2>Context automaton editor</h2></a>
<hr/>

<p align="justify">
    To create or edit the context automaton structure a proper edit mode should be set using the <b>edit mode panel</b>.
</p>
<br/>
<center><img src="img/ctx-automaton-panel.png"/></center>

<p align="justify">
    The type of the newly created object (state or edge) is set by checking the proper toggle button.
    With no button checked, one can transform the net by moving states around, etc.
    (see below for more details).
</p>

<br/>

<h3>States</h3>

<p align="justify">
    A new state is created by left-clicking the edit area (the main part of the component).
    As it is customary in automata theory, states are numbered separately starting from 1.
    The types of states are distinguished by shape and colour:
    the initial state is depicted as a square, all other states are depicted as circles.
    Moreover, hovering the mouse above a state allows to see its full description containing both
    its name and its (distinct) number.
</p>
<br/>
<center><img src="img/ctx-automaton-state.png"/></center>

<p align="justify">
    The details of a state can be edited by right-clicking the existing
    state and choosing the right option from the popup menu:
    <ul>
    <li><b>Set as initial</b> - Makes the selected state the initial state of the context automaton.</li>
    <li><b>Set label</b> - Allows to set the custom label for the selected state. Note that state labels have to be unique.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<br/>
<center><img src="img/ctx-automaton-state.png"/></center>

<h3>Edges</h3>

<p align="justify">
    A directed edge between two states is created by left-clicking both its endpoints in correct order.
    Each edge may contain several transitions, each of them defined by a <i>context</i> (additional entities
    provided for active processes/agents) and a <i>guard</i> (a condition required by the transition to execute).
    The list of transitions may be edited by right-clicking the existing
    edge and choosing the <b>Nondeterministic transitions</b> popup menu.
</p>
<center><img src="img/ctx-automaton-transition-edit.png"/></center>
<p align="justify">
    Hovering the mouse above an edge allows to see the full list of transitions
    including context and guards.
</p>
<center><img src="img/ctx-automaton-edge-details.png"/></center>

<br/>

<h3>Removing context automaton elements</h3>

<p align="justify">
    Switching the toggle button <b>Delete</b> on allows removing context automaton elements.
    Each left-clicked element is removed from the automaton grapn.
    Moreover, the entire context automaton graph may be deleted by clicking the <b>Clear</b> button.
</p>

<br/>

<h3>Transforming the context automaton graph</h3>

<p align="justify">
    Any state of the automaton may be picked and dragged around the edit area to obtain the desired graph shape.
    It is also possible to select multiple states and move them together at the same time.
    After <b>CTRL + left-click</b> on a particular state the entire automaton graph is shifted to be centered
    on the clicked state.
    Checking the <b>Lock relative nodes positions</b> checkbox locks the relative positions of the states.
    In that case, dragging a single state moves the entire automaton graph.
    Moreover, using mouse scroll the automaton graph view can be zoomed in and out.
</p>

<hr/>
<a name="trs-view"><h2>Transition system viewer</h2></a>
<hr/>

<p align="justify">
    The component offers the visualisation of the transition system representing the state space of the reaction systems.
    The initial state is depicted as a square, all other states are depicted as circles.
    There is a directed edge connecting the state S<sub>i</sub> to the state S<sub>j</sub>
    if S<sub>f</sub> is reachable from S<sub>i</sub> by a single computation step of the reaction system.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    The component has two separate instances represented by two separate tabs in the application window.
    The first visualises the complete state space of the reaction system,
    where each state is represented by sets of entities possessed by each agent and the current context automaton state.
    The second visualises the compressed state space, where context automaton states are ignored
    (states are represented only by the sets of entities possessed by each agent).
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Computation is done by pressing <b>Update transition system</b> button.
    The reaction system structure should be loaded from the file or edited manually for the computation to be possible.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Note that no matter in which component the <b>Update transition system</b> button
    is pressed, the transition system structure will be updated in both.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Hovering the mouse above a state allows to see its full description: entities possessed by each process/agent
    and the context automaton state (not present in the case of the compressed graph).
</p>

<h3>Transforming the transition system graph</h3>

<p align="justify">
    Any state of the transition system may be picked and dragged around the edit area to obtain the desired graph shape.
    It is also possible to select multiple states and move them together at the same time.
    After <b>CTRL + left-click</b> on a particular state the entire transition system graph is shifted to be centered

    Checking the <b>Lock relative nodes positions</b> checkbox locks the relative positions of the states.
    In that case, dragging a single state moves the entire transition system graph.
    Moreover, using mouse scroll the transition system graph view can be zoomed in and out.

<a name="model-checking"><h2>Model checking</h2></a>
<hr/>

<p align="justify">
Model checking is handled by the component at the bottom of the application window.
The properties of the analysed system are expressed as formulas following <b>rsCTLK</b> syntax.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The list of formulas may be modified using the following buttons:
<ul>
    <li><b>Add formula</b> - Creates an empty formula. The details of the formula should be specified in dialog shown below.</li>
    <li><b>Edit formula</b> - Allows to edit the details of a selected formula using dialog shown below.</li>
    <li><b>Remove formulas</b> - Removes selected formulas.</li>

</ul>
</p>
<center><img src="img/formula-details.png"/></center>
<p align="justify">
Verification of formulas against a system specification is done after selecting desired formulas
and clicking <b>Evaluate</b> button.
The result of the verification (<b>True</b>/<b>False</b>), as well as time and memory used are presented next to each verified formula.
</p>
<center><img src="img/model-checking.png"/></center>
<p align="justify">
Clicking the <b>Reset</b> button resets the status of the model checking.
Note that updating the reaction system specification (the list of processes, details of the reactions or the content automaton structure)
the results of model checking, if any, are reset automatically.
